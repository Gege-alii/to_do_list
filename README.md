To-Do List Application

A simple to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and stores tasks using `localStorage` to maintain persistence even after page reloads.

Features

- Add Task: Allows users to add a new task by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
  
- Edit Task: Users can edit an existing task. If no changes are made, a notification will be displayed informing the user that the task was not edited.
  
- Delete Task: Users can delete tasks, and a smooth fade-out animation will be applied before removal.
  
- Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, and the button will change from "Complete" to "Completed." Once completed, a task cannot be edited or marked as incomplete again.
  
- Notifications: Users are shown notifications for various actions (e.g., task added, task edited, task not changed, etc.).
  
- Persistent Data: All tasks are saved to `localStorage`, ensuring tasks persist even after page reloads.
